Hello New Heart Family! Normally, we greet one another by saying “How are you?” but in the New Heart Family we greet one another by asking “How is your heart?” because together we are a global family who longs to live the Fourth Day well.

As we witness God awakening nations, restoring families, and raising a generation who knows His heart, we are continually amazed by His grace. Our joy is to walk with you, pray with you, and see you strengthened in the goodness of God.

We believe this newsletter will help connect our global family, share testimonies of transformation, and encourage you as you walk out your calling. We bless you and your families — may God continue to strengthen you with a New Heart and a steadfast spirit every day.

With love,  
Pastors Jason & Youngmi Cha  
Founders / Global Directors, New Heart Ministry

    <h2>Ariel</h2>
    <p>
My sister's profound experience with New Heart 52 in Israel had a deep impact on me. Witnessing her transformation and her confession of faith in Jesus to our mother inspired me to attend New Heart in the USA in May 2025.

I was born into a devout Orthodox Jewish family, alongside my sister and our triplet brother. Our upbringing was steeped in the traditions of our faith. But as I grew older, despite fervent prayers and devotion, I longed for a deeper connection—a peace and love I could not find.

This longing led me to pray earnestly for truth, and six years ago I began studying the prophecies of the Hebrew Bible with an open heart. I was astonished to discover how clearly they pointed to Jesus as the Messiah. It was a profound awakening that transformed my spiritual life.

Getting permission to leave Israel during my army service—especially during an ongoing war—was extremely difficult. We booked the flight, prayed, and by God’s grace I received permission just one day before departure.

New Heart 53 was a time of immense transformation. Over three days, God gave me a new heart, deep peace, and undistracted communion with Him. I am truly grateful for the new spirit He placed within me.

    <h2>Ji</h2>
    <p>
Hello! I'm Ji Yeowoon, who served as the general affairs coordinator for New Heart Kids. This year, New Heart Kids was conducted in Korea for the first time, and although we were in the same location as the adults, we adjusted our schedules so the children would not cross paths with the adult candidates.

This year, 22 children ages 0–12 and 10 teachers spent 3 nights and 4 days together. Because everything was a first, the teachers were nervous, and the children—who spent the entire day away from their parents—were also tense and anxious at first.

New Heart Kids was full of discomfort. The children slept with people they didn’t know, followed a schedule they couldn’t control, couldn’t see their parents all day, had limited choices with meals, and had to follow rules in an unfamiliar environment. It even rained continuously, preventing outdoor activities.

And yet—they endured everything beautifully. They followed instructions even when unhappy, expressed themselves honestly, cried when they missed their parents, but ultimately stayed for the whole retreat without a single safety issue. On the final day, many didn’t want to go home and asked, “Will you do this again next year?”

As teachers, we planned many activities, but more than half were never used due to time and weather. But I believe God’s plan was fully accomplished. The children growing together—laughing, praying, singing, sleeping, and sharing space—was itself God’s intention. Children today rarely experience this kind of close, communal living.

We felt deeply connected with the adult New Heart even though we never directly joined them. When the children sang “Grace” and we later learned the adults had sung the same song, we were stunned—only the Holy Spirit could orchestrate such unity.

Every teacher had challenges—pregnancy, caring for infants, preparing meals, or dealing with children afraid of separation. But at the end, instead of complaints, everyone shared gratitude. Our hearts were united in love, service, and compassion, and we encouraged each other toward next year.

We truly became one beautiful body. I pray many more will join New Heart Kids next year, because God is truly doing something special among the children.

    <h2>Kyungjin (Maria)</h2>
    <p>
In May 2025, God opened a beautiful new chapter as we launched New Heart Kids #1 in Los Angeles. It was a long-awaited dream within the New Heart community to see all generations blessed through New Heart, and it was incredible to witness how God opened the door to make this dream a reality.

When I first joined New Heart Kids, my heart was especially for young parents. As a mother of four, I remembered the seasons when I felt spiritually dry and left out while raising my little ones. I wanted to serve in a way that would give parents space to be renewed and restored in God’s presence.

But as I served, God expanded my heart to embrace their children as well. Serving about twenty children—from toddlers to preteens—I saw firsthand how deeply God treasures each one of them. His desire is to raise and equip them as future leaders within the New Heart community.

There were challenging moments, but through it all, I witnessed both parents and children receiving one new heart through the Holy Spirit by the end of those three days.

With that same heart and encouragement, I was overjoyed to hear that we had New Heart Kids #2 in Korea in October. I believe this is God’s confirmation of His will to call us as a “family” and give His New Heart to all generations.

<strong>Compelled by the Fire: The Fourth Day</strong><br><br>

New Heart Ministry recently celebrated its 54th gathering in Korea, marking nearly two decades of God's undeniable grace across nations, including Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Ethiopia, Israel, and Korea. This movement is a divine summons igniting the promise of a New Heart (Ezekiel 36:26) in every generation and weaving us into one fierce, global Kingdom Family. Our commitment is comprehensive, extending to the New Heart Kids programs, which underscore our conviction that children are critical and active participants today, ensuring a legacy of passion that will sustain the movement for years to come.

<strong>The Fourth Day: Our Unstoppable Mandate</strong><br><br>

Our three-day gatherings are a deep immersion—a holy soaking in God's love and transformative power—but this is the preparation, not the end. We are compelled to live the Fourth Day: the daily, immediate application of our transformed hearts. It is an unstoppable mandate to reject spiritual stagnation and pursue sustained maturity in God’s goodness and grace by remaining connected. We are called to hold nothing back and serve in unified purpose (Acts 2) because isolation is not an option. Our strength is our unbreakable family covenant, spanning continents, and our commitment to raise a people of fire who will advance the global expansion God promised in Isaiah 54.

<strong>This Global Newsletter</strong><br><br>

As God’s vision for New Heart Ministry becomes clearer, we sense His urgent desire for us not only to document the mighty works He is doing, but also to become more deeply intertwined. This quarterly Global Newsletter is not optional—it is a necessity. It bridges nations, strengthens relationships, and nurtures our identity as one family. It provides a place to share testimonies, magnify the evidence of God's faithfulness, and stay aligned in our calling to walk out the Fourth Day together.

We must step forward. The Kingdom Family is not passive but an active force responding to God’s unshakeable vision. By His strength, we will fulfill every declaration spoken over this ministry.
