Hello New Heart Family!

Normally, we greet one another by saying, “How are you?” but in the New Heart Family we greet one another by asking, “How is your heart?” because together we are a global family who longs to live the Fourth Day well.

As we witness God awakening nations, restoring families, and raising a generation who knows His heart, we are continually amazed by His grace. Our joy is to walk with you, pray with you, and see you strengthened in the goodness of God.

We believe this newsletter will help connect our global family, share testimonies of transformation, and encourage you as you walk out your calling. We bless you and your families — may God continue to strengthen you with a New Heart and a steadfast spirit every day.

    <h2>Ariel</h2>
    <p>
My sister's profound experience with New Heart 52 in Israel had a deep impact on me. Witnessing her transformation and her confession of faith in Jesus to our mother inspired me to attend New Heart in the USA in May 2025.

I was born into a devout Orthodox Jewish family, alongside my sister and our triplet brother. Our upbringing was steeped in the traditions and teachings of our faith, and for many years, this was the foundation of my religion. However, as I grew older, a sense of unease began to stir within me. Despite my fervent prayers and commitment to our religious practices, I found myself yearning for a deeper connection, a more profound experience of God's peace and love, which I felt was lacking.

This spiritual yearning led me to seek guidance, and I prayed earnestly for God to lead me to the truth. About six years ago, my journey took a transformative turn. I began to research Jesus, approaching the subject with an open mind and a sincere desire to understand. What I discovered during this period of intense study and reflection was nothing short of revelatory. I delved into the prophecies of the Hebrew Bible and was astonished to see how clearly they pointed to Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah. The intricate details, the historical accuracy, and the profound theological implications of these prophecies resonated deeply within me. It was a profound awakening, confirming a truth that had been quietly stirring in my heart. This journey of discovery solidified my belief in Jesus, forever changing my spiritual path.

Getting permission to leave Israel during my army service, especially with the ongoing war, was challenging. We booked the flight, prayed earnestly, and by God's grace, I received permission just one day before I departed for the USA.

The New Heart program was a period of immense grace and personal change. Over three days, I grew closer to God by spending undistracted time with Him, a profoundly enriching experience. I am grateful to God for transforming my life and giving me a new heart during New Heart 53#.

    <h2>Choi Eun-Young</h2>
    <p>
1. **Gratitude**  
I cannot forget the spiritual leaders who delivered the Word, the praise team who gave their body and soul, the Palanca team who stayed up all night serving, those who poured love into food and snacks, the general affairs team who handled every hidden task, and above all, the Royo members who shared their lives with tears and love. I received a profound love I had never experienced before.

2. **Situation Before Going**  
I had been invited a year earlier and again this year — and I felt deeply that God Himself was inviting me. My family strongly opposed me going, especially since we knew nothing of the schedule. But I had two desperate reasons to go:  
• my husband was graduating seminary and retiring — we needed direction from God  
• I was spiritually exhausted and needed revival  

3. **Grace Received**  
From the moment I arrived, I experienced the hospitality and deep love of people who had encountered God’s grace. Through the lectures, testimonies, and prayers, God reflected my entire life back to me. He gently asked, “Eun-young, how are you using your money, time, and talents?”  

I had grown lazy and numb after years of burnout and physical pain. God awakened me again and called me back into the spiritual battle.

4. **After the Retreat**  
As we sang the theme song — “I Stand Up, I Will No Longer Let Pain Be Painful” — all my buried wounds resurfaced. I resolved to return to those wounds with the power of the cross.  

Pastor Kim said something that remains in my heart:  
**“If you fail after living according to your 3-day repentance, then begin another 3 days.”**  

I will live another “3 days,” again and again, walking in the grace God poured out.  
I give glory to God and thank every team member who poured out their hearts. De colores.

<strong>Compelled by the Fire: The Fourth Day</strong><br><br>

New Heart Ministry recently celebrated its 54th gathering in Korea, marking nearly two decades of God's undeniable grace across nations, including Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Ethiopia, Israel, and Korea. This movement is a divine summons igniting the promise of a New Heart (Ezekiel 36:26) in every generation and weaving us into one fierce, global Kingdom Family. Our commitment is comprehensive, extending to the New Heart Kids programs, which underscore our conviction that children are critical and active participants today, ensuring a legacy of passion that will sustain the movement for years to come.
<br><br>

<strong>The Fourth Day: Our Unstoppable Mandate</strong><br><br>

Our three-day gatherings are a deep immersion—a holy soaking in God's love and transformative power. But this is the preparation, not the end; we are utterly compelled to live the Fourth Day, which is the immediate, daily application of our radical, transformed hearts. It is our unstoppable mandate to reject spiritual stagnation and pursue sustained maturity in God's goodness and grace by remaining connected—to hold nothing back and serve in unified purpose (Acts 2). Isolation is not an option, for our strength is in our unbreakable family covenant spanning continents. We commit to the ultimate purpose of raising a people of fire and fulfilling the global expansion God promised in Isaiah 54.
<br><br>

<strong>This Global Newsletter</strong><br><br>

As God’s vision for New Heart Ministry continues to sharpen with undeniable clarity, we sense His urgent desire not only to document the mighty works and abundant grace flowing, but also for us—the Family—to become more intimately intertwined and nurtured. Hence, this quarterly Global Newsletter is a necessity, not an option. It is the intentional tool designed to bridge the miles and cultures across the world, to nurture global connections, and to ensure we care for one another as one body. It exists to share the undeniable evidence of God's faithfulness from every region, to solidify our collective faith, and to keep our focus sharp. It reminds us of our call to live out the Fourth Day together, fostering sustained growth and maturity.
<br><br>

We must step forward. The Kingdom Family is not a passive recipient of grace, but an active force compelled by an unwavering vision. By His strength, we will fulfill every declaration over this ministry.
